These notebooks are used during my master thesis "Comparing simulated and experimental X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy data from the European XFEL".

The for the SAXS and XPCS data, access to EuXFEL's data server is required.

The 2d sim no temp notebook is the main notebook used for the simulation data and results. With temp is an attampt at adding a growth and temperature factor to the simulation.

The 3d simulations are attempts to recreate the 2d simulation in 3 dimensions, very heavy.

The brown notebook is for the simulations of a single particle undergoing brownian motion.
